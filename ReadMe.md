After few months playing around with JavaScript and Node.js, also getting a good grasp about it. This time I'm looking for a new challenge by learning another programming language, and C++ is the answer.

Written in C++ with the help of [SDL2](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL) as library. This project is heavily inspired by an old game that I'm sure everyone knows, Snake game! Not Snakes & Ladders. Maybe you're interested to read some facts about the very first Snake game [here](https://blogs.windows.com/devices/2012/02/02/snake-charmed-10-fascinating-facts-about-the-worlds-most-popular-game).
